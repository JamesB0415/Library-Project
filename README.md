# Library Tracker Project!
Welcome to Version 0.0.2-alpha!

You can read the updates file if you want more insight to the current build!

In this version the project is barely functional. 

However HTML and CSS has been added! 

Later Versions there will be JavaScript, HTML, and CSS added for funcionality

## Current Features
In Version 0.0.2-alpha, as I mentioned above, you can check out the Updates file, 
I have added HTML and CSS to the main branch. Another design update will be added later on to for the main page due to small lack of CSS properties to certain areas.

View [Updates.md](Updates.md) for more info.

However stay tuned for coming updates!
