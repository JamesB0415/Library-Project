# v0.1.0
I have officially taken this project out of alpha! Welcome to the beta! 

In this update we have alot to cover because I have been hard at work.

## Main Updates
So first and for most, I have fully reconstructed the UI to look a little better. 

<img width="300px" alt="Login Screen Image" src="Images for ReadMe/betterLogin.png"/>

The background color may change, but it will be reflected on each page.

Additionally there are now error messages on the input boxes to show users that is is required and cant be left blank

## More Technical Updates
I have also added some functionality in the login screen. Users can now be taken to the register page and go back to login screens. Database has not been added yet so you cant make an account yet.

## Next Update
Next update I should have the base database set up so users can make an account just wont be able to add any books yet

The main user page should be fully customized and ready for shipping when the full product is available
