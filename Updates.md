# v0.0.2-alpha
In this update I added some styling and HTML to the main page.

Main page being the page most users will be seeing! 

## Main Updates

### Login Page
So the two main parts of this update are the login page and the main page. As for the login page the HTML and CSS is mostly complete, however designs are likely to change in the future!

### Main Page
As for the main page I got the general CSS and HTML done however I will be adding better CSS to elements like the button for instance. Currently it is very bland.
